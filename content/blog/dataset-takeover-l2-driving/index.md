A Dataset on Takeover during Distracted L2 Automated Driving

This project focuses on creating and analyzing a comprehensive dataset for understanding driver takeover behavior in Level 2 automated driving scenarios, particularly when drivers are distracted.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Automated Driving
- Driver Behavior Analysis
- Human-Machine Interaction
- Safety Research

**Methodology:**
- Data collection from simulated driving scenarios
- Analysis of takeover patterns and timing
- Distraction level assessment
- Safety metric evaluation

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Comprehensive dataset for autonomous driving research
- Insights into driver takeover behavior
- Safety guidelines for L2 automation
