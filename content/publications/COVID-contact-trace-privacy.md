# Too Much Information: Assessing Privacy Risks of Contact Trace Data Disclosure on People With COVID-19 in South Korea

## Abstract

With the COVID-19 outbreak, South Korea has been making contact trace data public to help people self-check if they have been in contact with a person infected with the coronavirus. Despite its benefits in suppressing the spread of the virus, publicizing contact trace data raises concerns about individuals' privacy.

In view of this tug-of-war between one's privacy and public safety, this work aims to deepen the understanding of privacy risks of contact trace data disclosure practices in South Korea.

## Research Methodology

In this study, publicly available contact trace data of 970 confirmed patients were collected from seven metropolitan cities in South Korea (20th Janâ€“20th Apr 2020). Then, an ordinal scale of relative privacy risk levels was introduced for evaluation, and the assessment was performed on the personal information included in the contact trace data, such as demographics, significant places, sensitive information, social relationships, and routine behaviors.

In addition, variance of privacy risk levels was examined across regions and over time to check for differences in policy implementation.

## Key Findings

### Data Disclosure Patterns

- **Demographics**: Most contact trace data showed the gender and age of the patients
- **Significant Places**: Disclosed home/work locations ranging across different levels of privacy risks in over 70% of the cases
- **Sensitive Information**: Inference on hobby, religion was made possible
- **Social Relationships**: 48.7% of the cases exposed the patient's social relationships

### Regional and Temporal Analysis

- **Regional Differences**: Considerable discrepancy was found in the privacy risk for each category across different regions
- **Policy Implementation**: Despite the recent release of government guidelines on data disclosure, its effects varied significantly

## Research Contributions

1. **Privacy Risk Assessment Framework**: Development of an ordinal scale for evaluating privacy risks in contact trace data
2. **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Analysis of 970 confirmed patients' data from seven metropolitan cities
3. **Multi-dimensional Privacy Analysis**: Assessment across demographics, locations, sensitive information, and social relationships
4. **Policy Impact Evaluation**: Examination of regional differences and temporal changes in data disclosure practices

## Privacy Risk Categories

The study evaluated privacy risks across several categories:

- **Demographics** (gender, age)
- **Significant Places** (home, work locations)
- **Sensitive Information** (hobbies, religion)
- **Social Relationships** (family, friends, colleagues)
- **Routine Behaviors** (daily patterns, activities)

## Dataset

- **Scope**: Seven metropolitan cities in South Korea
- **Period**: January 20 - April 20, 2020
- **Sample Size**: 970 confirmed COVID-19 patients
- **Data Type**: Publicly available contact trace data

## Policy Implications

The research highlights the tension between public health benefits and individual privacy rights in the context of COVID-19 contact tracing. The findings suggest the need for:

- **Balanced Disclosure Policies**: Guidelines that protect privacy while maintaining public health benefits
- **Regional Standardization**: Consistent implementation of privacy protection measures across regions
- **Risk-based Approaches**: Tailored disclosure practices based on privacy risk assessments
