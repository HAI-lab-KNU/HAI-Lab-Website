# Endpoint Device Risk-Scoring Algorithm Proposal for Zero Trust

## Abstract

The rapid expansion of remote work following the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the development of more robust and secure endpoint device security solutions. Companies have begun to adopt the zero trust security concept as an alternative to traditional network boundary security measures, which requires that every device and user be considered untrustworthy until proven otherwise.

Despite the potential benefits of implementing zero trust, the stringent security measures can inadvertently lead to low availability by denying access to legitimate users or limiting their ability to access necessary resources. To address this challenge, we propose a risk-scoring algorithm that balances confidentiality and availability by evaluating the user's impact on resources.

## Key Contributions

Our contributions include:

1. **Limitations Analysis**: Summarizing the limitations of existing risk scoring systems in companies that implement zero trust
2. **Dynamic Importance Metric**: Proposing a dynamic importance metric that measures the importance of resources accessible to users within zero trust systems
3. **Risk-Scoring Algorithm**: Introducing a risk-scoring algorithm that employs the dynamic importance metric to enhance both security and availability in zero trust environments

## Methodology

By incorporating the dynamic importance metric, our proposed algorithm provides a more accurate representation of risk, leading to better security decisions and improved resource availability for legitimate users. This proposal aims to help organizations achieve a more balanced approach to endpoint device security, addressing the unique challenges posed by the increasing prevalence of remote work.

## Impact

This research addresses critical security challenges in the post-COVID-19 remote work environment, providing organizations with a more balanced approach to endpoint device security that maintains both security and availability.
