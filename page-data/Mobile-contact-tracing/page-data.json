Traditionally, contact tracers in local health offices interview an infected person to identify visited places (or hotspots) and then check any close contacts.</p>\n<p>For the accurate recall of travel history, several countries including South Korea corroborate multiple data sources such as cell location or credit card transactions. Beside this traditional approach, various mobile apps were introduced to help improve travel history tracking including automated GPS tracking (e.g., Israel's HaMagen) and manual place QR-code scanning (e.g., New Zealand's NZ COVID Tracer and Korea's KI Pass).</p>\n<h2>Mobile Contact Tracing Approaches</h2>\n<p>Alternatively, mobile apps maintain individuals' \"encounter history\" (instead of place visit history) by leveraging peer-to-peer wireless beaconing (i.e., self-announcing its presence to nearby devices) with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in smartphones such as Google-Apple's Exposure Notification and Singapore's BlueTrace and TraceTogether. This encounter history can be used later to judge whether a user had a risky encounter with an infected person.</p>\n<h2>Key Argument</h2>\n<p>We argue that traditional manual contact tracing can be greatly improved by leveraging the wisdom of crowds. Local community members install mobile apps to self-collect \"breadcrumbs\" for contact tracing such as GPS traces, place QR-codes, and wireless encounter histories, which can offer near real-time assessment.</p>\n<h2>Research Focus</h2>\n<p>However, there is a systematic lack of adoption of mobile apps in many countries, and this research explores the benefits and challenges of mobile contact tracing from tracing capacity perspectives.</p>\n<h2>Key Contributions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Traditional vs. Mobile Tracing</strong>: Comparison of traditional manual contact tracing with mobile-based approaches</li>\n<li><strong>Technology Analysis</strong>: Examination of GPS tracking, QR-code scanning, and BLE beaconing methods</li>\n<li><strong>Capacity Perspectives</strong>: Analysis of tracing capacity improvements through mobile technology</li>\n<li><strong>Adoption Challenges</strong>: Investigation of systematic barriers to mobile app adoption</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p>This research provides critical insights into how mobile technology can enhance COVID-19 contact tracing efforts, offering practical guidance for public health officials and policymakers on implementing effective digital contact tracing solutions.</p>\n<h2>Publication Details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Journal</strong>: Frontiers in Public Health</li>\n<li><strong>Volume</strong>: 9</li>\n<li><strong>Pages</strong>: 586615</li>\n<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: Frontiers Media SA</li>\n<li><strong>Publication Date</strong>: March 18, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Citation</h2>\n<p>Lee, U., &#x26; Kim, A.
