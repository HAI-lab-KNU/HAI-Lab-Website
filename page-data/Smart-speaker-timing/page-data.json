Opportune moments for proactive interactions with smart speakers</h1>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Increasing number of researchers and designers are envisioning a wide range of novel proactive conversational services for smart speakers such as context-aware reminders and restocking household items. When initiating conversational interactions proactively, smart speakers need to consider users' contexts to minimize disruption.</p>\n<p>In this work, we aim to broaden our understanding of opportune moments for proactive conversational interactions in domestic contexts. Toward this goal, we built a voice-based experience sampling device and conducted a one-week field study with 40 participants living in university dormitories.</p>\n<h2>Research Methodology</h2>\n<p>From 3,572 in-situ user experience reports, we proposed 19 activity categories to investigate contextual factors related to interruptibility. Our data analysis results show that the key determinants for opportune moments are closely related to both personal contextual factors such as busyness and environmental factors.</p>\n<h2>Key Contributions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Voice-based Experience Sampling</strong>: Development of a novel device for collecting in-situ user experience data</li>\n<li><strong>Field Study</strong>: One-week study with 40 participants in university dormitories</li>\n<li><strong>Activity Categorization</strong>: 19 activity categories for understanding interruptibility</li>\n<li><strong>Contextual Analysis</strong>: Investigation of personal and environmental factors affecting opportune moments</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Research Findings</h2>\n<p>The study revealed that opportune moments for proactive interactions are determined by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personal contextual factors</strong> (e.g., busyness, emotional state)</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental factors</strong> (e.g., location, time of day)</li>\n<li><strong>Activity type</strong> and current engagement level</li>\n<li><strong>Social context</strong> and presence of others</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dataset</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Participants</strong>: 40 university dormitory residents</li>\n<li><strong>Duration</strong>: One-week field study</li>\n<li><strong>Data Points</strong>: 3,572 in-situ user experience reports</li>\n<li><strong>Categories</strong>: 19 activity categories for analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p>This research provides crucial insights for designing proactive conversational services that minimize disruption while maximizing user engagement.
