However, little is known about how commitment devices are used in the wild, and what aspects of commitment devices are related to goal achievements.</p>\n<p>In this paper, we explore a large-scale dataset from stickK, an online behavior change support system that provides both financial and social commitments. We characterize the patterns of behavior change goals (e.g., topics and commitment setting) and then perform a series of multilevel regression analyses on goal achievements.</p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p>Our results reveal that successful goal achievements are largely dependent on the configuration of financial and social commitment devices, and a mixed commitment setting is considered beneficial. We discuss how our findings could inform the design of effective commitment devices.</p>\n<h2>Research Approach</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dataset</strong>: Large-scale data from stickK, an online behavior change support system</li>\n<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Multilevel regression analyses on goal achievements</li>\n<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Financial and social commitment devices</li>\n<li><strong>Method</strong>: Characterization of behavior change goal patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Key Contributions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pattern Analysis</strong>: Characterization of behavior change goals (topics and commitment setting)</li>\n<li><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>: Multilevel regression analyses on goal achievements</li>\n<li><strong>Design Implications</strong>: Insights for effective commitment device design</li>\n<li><strong>Real-world Understanding</strong>: Analysis of commitment devices usage in the wild</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p>This research provides valuable insights into how commitment devices work in real-world settings, informing the design of more effective behavior change support systems that can help users achieve their goals through strategic use of financial and social commitments.</p>\n<h2>Publication Details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conference</strong>: CHI 2021 - ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</li>\n<li><strong>Pages</strong>: 1-16</li>\n<li><strong>Publication Date</strong>: May 6, 2021</li>\n<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: ACM</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Citation</h2>\n<p>Lee, H., Kim, A., Hong, H., &#x26; Lee, U.
