To prevent traffic accidents in advance, drivers need to be aware of road conditions, but it is nearly impossible for drivers to be aware of all traffic situations. However, when a passenger is present in the vehicle, they can warn the driver about blind spots that the driver cannot see or unexpected accidents, thereby preventing accidents.</p>\n<p>This study proposes a voice driving assistance agent that provides driving assistance guidance like a passenger, and aims to derive design requirements that should be considered when developing such an agent. To derive design requirements, this study recruited participant teams consisting of passengers and drivers, observed passenger driving guidance during actual road driving, and conducted interviews and surveys on passenger driving assistance guidance during experimental road driving and daily life, deriving three major themes and discussing related design implications.</p>\n<h2>Research Motivation</h2>\n<p>Traffic accidents in Korea are among the highest among OECD countries. Approximately 1.2 million people die and 5 million people are injured in traffic accidents annually. This is not just a problem in Korea. Globally, traffic accidents caused by automobiles are causing serious socio-economic damage.</p>\n<p>Most of these traffic accidents are caused by driver carelessness or poor operation. For example, accidents occur when drivers cannot respond quickly to dangerous situations such as when the car in front suddenly stops or when a pedestrian suddenly appears on a side street.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, having a passenger in the vehicle during dangerous situations helps prevent accidents. According to related studies, when experienced drivers drive with passengers, the risk of accidents is about 1.5 times lower than when driving alone. Similarly, Cooper's study showed that when comparing novice drivers, those with passengers had lower driver error rates than those without passengers.</p>\n<h2>Research Objectives</h2>\n<p>This study aims to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Design Requirements Investigation</strong>: Survey design requirements for developing a voice driving assistance agent</li>\n<li><strong>Passenger Behavior Analysis</strong>: Understand how passengers provide guidance to drivers</li>\n<li><strong>Agent Development Guidelines</strong>: Derive design implications for voice driving assistance agents</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Research Methodology</h2>\n<p>The study recruited participant teams consisting of passengers who usually provide driving guidance to drivers and the corresponding drivers from online communities. The experiment was conducted in the following order: (1) explanation of experimental purpose and procedure, (2) road driving, (3) interview, (4) survey.</p>\n<h3>Data Collection Process</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Road Driving</strong>: Participants drove along the route presented by the experimenter</li>\n<li><strong>Observation</strong>: Researchers observed passenger guidance during actual driving</li>\n<li><strong>Interviews</strong>: Conducted interviews about provided guidance</li>\n<li><strong>Surveys</strong>: Collected opinions on situations where driving assistance would be helpful</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<h3>1.
