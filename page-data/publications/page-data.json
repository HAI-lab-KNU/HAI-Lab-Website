However, publicly available datasets on this topic are scarce. This study introduces TD2D, a rich dataset collected from 50 drivers using an L2 automated driving simulator, balanced in gender and age. The dataset includes 500 takeover cases across 10 conditions—spanning no task, visual, and auditory secondary tasks. It provides data on takeover performance, workload, physiological signals, and ocular measures. TD2D offers a significant contribution to advancing research in safe automated driving and intelligent driver monitoring systems.\n","paper":"/paper/A_Dataset_on_Takeover_during_Distracted_L2_Automated_Driving.pdf","slide":"","video":null,"award":null}},{"id":"06a5b0bd-0716-5817-b868-5b3757fad942","excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/Effects-of-In-Vehicle-Auditory-Interactions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Effects of In-Vehicle Auditory Interactions on Takeover Performance in SAE L2 Semi-Automated Vehicles","authors":"Jiwoo Hwang, Woohyeok Choi, Auk Kim","journal":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","type":null,"year":"2025","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2024.103401","abstract":"In SAE Level 2 semi-automated driving environments, auditory secondary tasks—though not visually or manually distracting—can reduce takeover performance. This study examined how different levels of auditory task difficulty impact driver reaction during takeover events. Using a driving simulator and physiological monitoring of 50 participants, the research found that auditory tasks significantly influenced takeover quality. Moreover, physiological signals such as pupil diameter, eye movement dispersion, and inter-beat interval were associated with takeover performance. The findings suggest potential for real-time systems to estimate cognitive load and manage interruptions more intelligently.\n","paper":"/paper/IJHCS_smartCar.pdf","slide":"","video":null,"award":null}},{"id":"b5eac3ad-6595-5fac-8b7d-a938c5ec6157","excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/Exploring-Context-Aware-Mental-Health-Self-Tracking/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Exploring Context-Aware Mental Health Self-Tracking Using Multimodal Smart Speakers in Home Environments","authors":"Jieun Lim, Youngji Koh, Auk Kim, Uichin Lee","journal":"Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '24)","type":"Conference","year":"2024","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642834","abstract":"People with mental health issues often remain indoors, limiting their outdoor activities. This emphasizes the importance of in-home self-tracking technologies to gain insights into mental health conditions. This study introduces a proactive self-tracking system using multimodal smart speakers that deliver mental health surveys through the experience sampling method (ESM). The system detects context transitions to determine optimal delivery moments and allows users to respond via voice or touch. A four-week field study with 20 participants showed that context-aware ESM delivery improved compliance. Participants preferred touch over voice interaction, and the modality preference varied by context.\n","paper":"/paper/CHI24Multimodal.pdf","slide":"","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqpiW3gaO4s","award":null}},{"id":"1b67c980-3df3-5bda-bf15-825b8e08c006","excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/Interrupting-for-Microlearning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interrupting for Microlearning: Understanding Perceptions and Interruptibility of Proactive Conversational Microlearning Services","authors":"Minyeong Kim, Jiwook Lee, Youngji Koh, Chanhee Lee, Uichin Lee, Auk Kim","journal":"Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '24)","type":"Conference","year":"2024","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642778","abstract":"Significant investment of time and effort for language learning has prompted a growing interest in microlearning.\nWhile microlearning requires frequent participation in 3-to-10-minute learning sessions, the widespread adoption of smart speakers in homes presents a new opportunity to proactively provide microlearning in daily life.\nHowever, such proactive provision may distract users.

Prior methods mainly focused on computer-based or neuropsychological tests, yet the potential of daily smartphone interactions remains underexplored. This study introduces the concept of Smartphone-based Activities of Daily Living (S-ADL), inspired by Instrumental ADL (I-ADL), to detect BAC. A controlled laboratory experiment with 40 young adults assessed the feasibility of using S-ADLs—such as SMS response delay, web search behavior, and financial task handling—as indicators of BAC levels. The study demonstrates that S-ADL metrics significantly correlate with BAC, offering a promising direction for non-invasive, real-world alcohol monitoring using smartphones.\n","paper":"/paper/CHI24SADL.pdf","slide":"","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4jMDuCoaOA","award":"Best Paper Honorable Mention Award"}},{"id":"2602a81f-e557-5fa9-b155-1c768bba84d8","excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/IoT-Enabled-Patch-with-Microsensors/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Internet of Things-Enabled Patch with Built-in Microsensors and Wireless Chip: Real-Time Remote Monitoring of Patch Treatment","authors":"Jiwoo Hwang, Kyu-Seong Jo, Min-Seo Kim, Sunghwan Choi, Jungmin Lee, Auk Kim, Yung-Ju Yoo","journal":"Translational Vision Science & Technology","type":"Journal","year":"2024","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.13.5.18","abstract":"This study developed and evaluated an IoT-enabled patch with built-in microsensors and a wireless chip to enable real-time, remote monitoring of adherence during patch treatment for amblyopia.
